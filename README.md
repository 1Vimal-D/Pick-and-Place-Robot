# Pick-and-Place-Robot
An Arduino-based robotic arm that uses a servo motor to pick up and place objects. The robot simulates the basic operations of an industrial robotic arm.

🛠️ Components Used
Arduino Uno

Servo Motor (SG90 or similar)

Jumper Wires

Breadboard (optional, for testing)

Power Supply (Battery or USB)

⚙️ How It Works
The servo arm rotates to the pickup position to grab an object.

After picking it up, the arm moves to the place position to place the object.

The movement is simulated with two fixed angles for the servo.

💡 Applications
Automated assembly lines

Warehouse sorting and packaging

Educational tool for learning robotics

📐 Circuit Connections
Servo Motor Signal → Pin 9

Servo Motor VCC → 5V

Servo Motor GND → GND

🧠 Future Enhancements
Add sensors for object detection (e.g., IR or ultrasonic)

Integrate a gripper for better object handling

Implement multiple axes for more complex movements
